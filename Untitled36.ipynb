Drawing upon the historical and theoretical underpinnings of financial reporting, we conclude with recommendations about the prospects for the accounting profession to provide value-added information related to sustainability issues.',\n",

Most analyses, however, assume that policy regimes are fixed. Using a fully nonlinear New Keynesian model with endogenous policy regime uncertainty, we show that inflation-driven expectations about switching to the debt-financing regime reduce money-financed spending multipliers. When interacting with high government debt, policy regime uncertainty decreases money-financed multipliers below one. This conclusion holds at the zero lower bound and with a large spending increase. Also, policy regime uncertainty similarly decreases multipliers under active fiscal and passive monetary policies, in which seigniorage is implicitly used to finance government spending.',\n",

We find that more innovative firms are less likely to cut R&D in order to meet earnings benchmarks. Consistent with R&D cuts being used to signal stronger future performance, we find that innovative firms that cut R&D to meet benchmarks have higher future earnings and operating cash flows. Results are concentrated among firms with greater R&D intensity and for firms operating in poor information environments. Overall, results suggest that managers of innovative firms have a long-term focus and are unwilling to sacrifice long-term performance to meet short-term benchmarks.',\n",

We examine whether this partisan bias is present in management earnings forecasts. We find that firms with CEOs whose partisanship aligns with that of the US president issue more optimistically biased forecasts than firms with CEOs who are not aligned. Our results suggest CEOs fall prey to partisan bias, resulting in suboptimal forecasting behavior. Additionally, we find that investors fail to discount the news in forecasts issued by partisan-aligned CEOs and that post-forecast abnormal returns are lower for these firms.',\n",

We find that a clean-break with the use of traditional fuels is less likely in rural areas, but more probable in urban areas. The household characteristics (e.g. income, education) that are positively correlated with use of clean fuel also increases the probability of fuel stacking for rural households. We also find that access to paved road is an important determinant for rural household adopting clean fuel, and there exists evidence of social spillover effects in rural areas. ',\n",

During normalization, interest payments remain above the path without the ZLB, and government debt can increase further despite the recovery of output and tax revenues. Against the yardstick of ability to pay, interest rate normalization is unlikely to threaten federal debt sustainability at the current net federal debt level about 100% of GDP.

Consequently, the following is a description and discussion of the earliest of all legitimacy types to be attained, ex nihilo legitimacy.

The institutionalization of cronyism as a rational practice within a context promotes rewards for unproductive behaviors at the expense of productive behaviors.

Moreover, this research examines the moderating role of formal, inclusive institutions—rule of law—on the relation between cronyism and entrepreneurial motives. Analysis of data from 96 countries over 7 years provides empirical support for the notion that productive entrepreneurship and cronyism are inversely related.    ',\n",

Previous studies have suggested that consumers wanted to have service robots in the areas such as front desk, concierge, and room service within a hotel. However, the interaction comfort and perceived service quality with service robot at these three settings remain sparse. Thus, this study investigates the effects of service encounter types and service settings through a number of scenario-based experiments on customer behavioral intentions together with context-dependent factors informed by prior consumer research.',\n",

Pipeline business models are significantly different from platform business models, as aforementioned. The triatic business model has made the branding process different from the pipeline business models (Van Alstyne, Parker, & Choudary, 2016; Wirtz et al., 2019). Thus, it is critical to investigate branding related issues with both pipeline business and platform businesses to understand the factors that keep customers with the platform (Wirtz et al., 2019). Taken together, this study aims to explore if platform branding differs from pipeline business branding, as well as the role of customer engagement in building customer loyalty.',\n",

Despite numerous reviews of this topic in the organizational behavior, and psychology, there is little investigation of decision making in multi-team systems. This is surprising, given the extreme decision-making context faced by multi-team systems—such as high uncertainty, time pressure, emotionally charged, and consequential extremes. I will study the role of strategic decision making and contextual factors in multi-team systems, composed of three five-person, functionally specialized component teams, which will be engaged in an exercise that is simultaneously “laboratory-like” and “field-like.” ',\n",

       "  'Intraorganizational knowledge transfer is difficult yet critical for numerous organizational outcomes. The knowledge-sharing behavior of middle managers, those often tasked with managing this knowledge transfer, should, however, not be taken for granted. This paper aims to develop an understanding of the underlying motives middle managers have when coordinating knowledge transfer between teams that are in coopetition, i.e. engage simultaneously in cooperative and competitive behaviors. Specifically, I argue that coopetition may prompt middle managers to adopt more myopic motives that make these managers less inclined to coordinate knowledge exchange between teams in their organization.

These divergent and integrative strategic roles of middle managers are crucial to the strategy process. We argue that the complexity of middle managers’ identity will influence their perceived role conflict and will consequently determine their strategic role performance. Moreover, we hypothesize that managers’ organizational identification affects whether they perform better at the divergent or integrative part of their strategic role.

However, relationships can be inadequate in terms of quality and quantity, creating a two-dimensional view of loneliness.

Emotional loneliness, due to insufficient relationship closeness, increases brand loyalty, whereas social loneliness, due to insufficient number of relationships, increases preference for greater brand assortment, creating the appearance of weaker loyalty to any one brand.

Based on a sample of 249 undergraduate student teams, we first consider the role that the individual’s and their partner’s motivation-to-lead and political skill play in determining the extent to which the person adjusts his/her response to an ethical dilemma to reflect greater sensitivity to moral issues.\\nSponsor: Oklahoma State University\\nPI/PDs: Karen Flaherty, Jim Pappas',\n",

The authors test their theoretical framework across two large-scale field studies featuring spatial econometric analyses. If managers fail to consider contagion systematically, the effects of targeted discounts can spill over to untargeted buyers, resulting in approximately three times the margin losses. Granting highly differentiated discounts further fuels this contagion process, precipitating even greater margin decline. However, contagion-conscious deployment, such as targeting buyers that limit e-commerce price transparency, allows sellers to virtually eliminate adverse effects of discount contagion.',\n",

       "  'Prior macro-level research on ICT4Ds has measured country-level development using resource- or utilitarian-based approaches. We argue for a people-centered lens using the capability approach, using opportunity and process freedoms. Four conversion factors of ICTs are identified as enablers/restrictors of opportunity or freedoms. Using archival data and a 2SLS model, we test ICT-cost and ICT-infrastructure, and the interaction of e-participation and freedoms on ICTs to predict a country’s human development (HD). Results suggest that cost and infrastructure significantly affect HD, e-participation interacts with freedoms on ICTs such that freedom is only effective when accompanied by high levels of e-participation within a country.',\n",

We find a negative association between code of ethics quality and cash holdings which suggests that managers hold less cash when the firm has a strong code of ethics in place. The effect is greater when agency costs are elevated due to weaker country-level investor protections. We also find that payouts and the marginal value of cash holdings to investors are increasing in code quality. Overall, our results are consistent with ethics codes helping to limit opportunistic behavior from managers when determining the firm’s level of cash holdings. ',\n",

At the ZLB, falling tax revenues and real bond prices increase government debt accumulation. During normalization, interest payments remain above the path without the ZLB, and government debt can increase further despite the recovery of output and tax revenues. Against the yardstick of ability to pay, interest rate normalization is unlikely to threaten federal debt sustainability at the current net federal debt level about 100% of GDP. If the government fails to reform Social Security and major healthcare programs, sovereign default risk can rise more quickly when debt reaches 150% of GDP. ',\n",

When interacting with high government debt, policy regime uncertainty decreases money-financed multipliers below one. This conclusion holds at the zero lower bound and with a large spending increase.

The current 2x2 experimental study will be set in a simulated social media environment where a luxury hospitality brand is in the midst of a SMF, addressing the call for more research on the diffusion of negative messages on brand management.',\n",

As organizations continue to adopt agile methods, understanding how to sustain agile methods is a growing concern. In recent years, researchers have focused their attention on the issues of sustained agile use in order to extend our knowledge on agile assimilation. However, little research has been conducted to expose the assimilation gaps that occur as organizations seek to increase the extent and intensity of their agile use. Following prior literature, we investigate the role of organizational factors in the continuance of agile methods. ',\n",

Our findings suggest that focused financial incentives, representing situations where financial rewards are administered exclusively on the basis of excellent performance, offer the best outcome for predicting PI.  Findings provide support for cognitive evaluation theory and insight into the role of financial incentives in a COCB context.',\n",

       "  \"The use of an Internet testbed technology named ISEAGE allows students to design and implement fully functional networks using public IP space that is contained in the testbed. To the students, it appears as if they were directly connected to the Internet while still being protected. This paper shows that ‘real world’ projects using virtual lab technology can have a positive effect both on objective networking knowledge, as well as subjective self-assessments of self-efficacy with regard to implementing the technology. It also demonstrates that ‘real world’ final projects encourage student thinking at upper levels of Bloom's taxonomy.\",\n",

This argues that mask mandates by major metro areas can be beneficial to neighboring communities.',\n",

A mindset is a combination of cognitive filters and processes through which professionals interpret their professional environments and execute their professional responsibilities. We identify five key mindsets relevant for accounting graduates. We treat the \"public interest mindset\" (focus on \"we\" vs. \"I,\" integrity, and professionalism) as foundational. The four other key mindsets include:  1) growth,  2) professional skepticism,        3) analytical/digital, and 4) global. We define and discuss each of these mindsets and suggest potential pedagogical approaches for integrating these mindsets into 21st-century accounting education.',\n",

Increasing (decreasing) deposit insurance premiums when a bank is performing poorly (well) has the potential to further constrain bank lending ability.

Using credit unions as a suitable control group we estimate the impact of insurance premiums on bank lending.

A Smooth Transition VAR model is employed to document the state-dependent dynamics of two distinct types of uncertainty shocks, financial market based and news-based.  When nonlinearity is allowed to play a role in our model, quantitatively very different asymmetric dynamics are observed.

At the ZLB, falling tax revenues and real bond prices increase government debt accumulation. During normalization, interest payments remain above the path without the ZLB, and government debt can increase further despite the recovery of output and tax revenues. Against the yardstick of ability to pay, interest rate normalization is unlikely to threaten federal debt sustainability at the current net federal debt level about 100% of GDP. If the government fails to reform Social Security and major healthcare programs, sovereign default risk can rise more quickly when debt reaches 150% of GDP.',\n",

When interacting with high government debt, policy regime uncertainty decreases money-financed multipliers below one. This conclusion holds at the zero lower bound and with a large spending increase.

These findings enrich the literature on human-computer interaction and provide some marketing implications for firms to improve product evaluation and purchase behavior by the means of human-computer interaction.',\n",

We chose the second perspective and tested how different product recall strategies (proactive vs. passive) influence competitors’ financial values. We collected 14 years (January 1996 to December 2009) of CPSC product recalls, and found that competitors experience positive abnormal returns when the recall firm employs proactive recall strategies. This confirms that investors interpret proactive recall differently from consumers. Proactive recall not only hurts the recall firm’s stock prices but benefits competitors’ financial values.',\n",

Interactions among users of social media platforms (SMP) do not rely on user agreements. As a form of social exchange, information sharing on SMPs uses a psychological contract (PC; implicit and assumed reciprocal obligations). This study investigates how PC violations (PCVs) affect sharing intentions on SMPs. We find that sharing intention is negatively influenced by interpersonal and institutional PCVs through privacy concern and trust. PCV by another user positively influences the perceived violation by the SMP, suggesting a collateral damage of interpersonal-PCV towards the SMP.',\n",

Landlords are usually not co-located with lodging units rented through short-term agents, such as Airbnb and VRBO. Application of smart thermostats, plugs, and energy monitors can have a significant impact on costs without a comparable increase in operational burden. Using a case study of five properties, we assess the impact of these devices and explore additional benefits derived from behavioral changes by tenants due to the presence of these devices.',\n",
